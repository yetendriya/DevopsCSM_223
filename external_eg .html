	<h1>WELCOME TO DEVOPS</h1>
	<p> DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, 
practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver
 applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.</p>
